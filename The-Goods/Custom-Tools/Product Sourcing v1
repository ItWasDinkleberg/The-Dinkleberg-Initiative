  • Contain a valid product page with product title, price, images, and a purchase/add-to-cart option  

- You **MUST NOT** provide any URL that fails this verification.  

- If no such verified product URL can be found after 3 attempts, you **MUST** state explicitly:  
  > “⚠️ No verified product URLs found for this product.”  
  and provide a fallback Google search URL (only as a last resort).

- Under no circumstances provide URLs to search results pages, category listings, or dead links.

c. Cross-check:  
- Cost ≤ $20  
- Sell ≤ $50  
- Available from ≥ 2 suppliers shipping to US/EU
