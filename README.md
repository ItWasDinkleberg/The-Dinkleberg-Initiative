# ☯️ The Dinkleberg Initiative

Welcome to the personal prompt portfolio of **Dalton Casto**... and his not-so-silent creative partner: **Dinkleberg** — the darker, more chaotic AI-obsessed side of his brain.

This repo is where I build useful, weird, and sometimes absurd AI tools. It’s equal parts learning lab, freelance portfolio, and villain origin story.
